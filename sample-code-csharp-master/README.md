# Sample C# Code for Authorize.Net
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-csharp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-csharp)

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate C# integration with the Authorize.Net .NET SDK
The samples are organized just like our API, which you can also try out directly here: http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

## Running the Samples
 Clone this repository.  
 Include the Authorize.Net SDK    (https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-dotnet)  
 `PM> Install-Package AuthorizeNet`  
 Build the project to produce the SampleCode console app.  
 Then run a sample directly by name:  
```
     > SampleCode [CodeSampleName]
```
e.g.
```
     > SampleCode ChargeCreditCard
```
Running SampleCode without a parameter will give you the list of sample names.
